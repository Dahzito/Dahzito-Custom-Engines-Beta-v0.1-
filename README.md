# Dahzito-Custom-Engines-Beta-v0.1-
Basic mod that adds some engines to the game.

So, for now this mod only adds 1 engine to the game called **Odyssey Engine.**
It's a good engine to be used on light second stage rockets and when used on space when thrust isn't much of a problem. (a bit simillar to the Frontier Engine)


**Relevant Informations:**

**Mass**: 5 Tons

**Thrust**: 70 Tons

**Efficiency**: 320 Isp
