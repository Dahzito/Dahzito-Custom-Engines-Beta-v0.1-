# Dahzito-Custom-Engines-v0.6-
Basic mod that adds for now 12 engines to the SFS game.
This mod adds for now a decent variety of engines into the game that can offer an interesting alternative to the already well known Vanilla engines, this mod can include engines that can extend, from some simple engines for some missions were you would need another type of engine, to an entire version of an Dahzito version of the AEP mod made by Orion (also the suggestion of this was made by Orion) and some Soviet-tech rocket engines.

Planned future releases & other small updates:

***0.6.1 | 0.6-bug_fix update:** small bug fixes to the engines

  ***0.7 update:** complete version of the Dahzito version of the AEP mod
  ***0.8 update:** going to implement some soviet inspired and some soviet engines recretions (one of them is going to be an suggestion made here)
  ***0.9 update:** still don't know well yet, might going to include some rocket engines inspired on American rocket engines | Open for suggestions for this and for the 1.0 update
